Western Devs is live!

Some years ago, a...unique...group of developers would gather at conferences and talk. They'd talk about software practices, interesting tools, and smoked meat. Whatever the topic, it was always lively and, on occasion, productive.

Eventually, a young visionary by the name of Dave Woods formed an ad hoc mailing list for these developers to continue the conversation between conferences. Members came and went and the list eventually moved to Slack. But over the years, the underlying conversations remained the same, low on ego, high on either technical content or entertainment value, often both.

WesternDevs.com is our attempt to bring that value to the masses. In these pages, you'll delve into the hearts, the minds, indeed the very *souls* of the people behind WesternDevs. And you'll come out the richer for it.

So welcome to our little cabana. Look around and join the conversation.
