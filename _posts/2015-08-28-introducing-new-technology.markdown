We had another good discussion recently on our Slack group, this time framed around F# and C#. Here is a summary of the points that were bandied about.

The underlying issue: If a company is starting new development and has existing talent in C#, does it make sense to explore a new language like F# which is, arguably, more efficient.

We didn't explore the subject nature of whether F# is a "better" language than C# and instead assumed that if you are proficient in F#, you would be more efficient than a C# developer. Not necessarily an accurate assumption but there's a reason our Slack channel is private: so we can focus on the interesting topic without some yahoo whinging on the semantics of a programming language. (I.e. we covered that topic off last week)

There appear to be conflicting forces at work. On the one hand, the company has existing talent that's already trained in one language. Furthermore, if they need to expand (or replace), C# developers are more readily available. From their perspective, at least in the short term, C# is the obvious choice.

But there are some counter-arguments:

### Developers want to learn

Yes, your existing talent knows C#. But maybe they want to try new things. Why not a new programming language that could, in the long term, make them more efficient? And keep them happy at the same time.

### Higher quality code

The argument here is, after your team becomes proficient, they'll spend less time in development and produce higher-quality, more maintainable code.

### Higher quality talent pool

Yes, there are a lot of C# developers around. That means you need to weed out the good from the bad. With a more "outre" language like F#, your local talent will, almost by definition, be more motivated to learn and to maintain high quality code.

### Attract better talent

If there is a smaller pool of F# developers, that implies there aren't many places offering F# development. You could improve your recruitment efforts without even having to advertise.


The counter-counter-argument, of course, is that this is all subjective. The same arguments can be said about Ruby instead of F# so why not learn Ruby? Or Postgres instead of SQL Server? Where does the rabbit hole end?

And to put this in perspective: the choice of programming language is rarely, if ever, the barrier to success.

Ultimately, it comes down to: who is responsible for cultivating the development landscape? Some organizations relish being on the fringe and do well there. Others view their development team as a means to an end. Get it done with minimal impact on the rest of the business.

Your company's culture will dictate this to some degree. Even if they are in the second camp, maybe all they need is a catalyst. Someone with strong enough convictions to convince them to try something new for the potential long term (and likely intangible) benefit of the company.

As with many of our discussions, there are several ways we could dive deeper into this. Is there a way to quantify the benefit? How do you decide which causes to take up? What kind of trade-offs can be made when introducing a new technology to a company that's leery about it? Perhaps those involved will elaborate in follow up posts. For now, one more shout-out to Slack from the Western Devs.
