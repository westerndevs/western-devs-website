####Synopsis

What is the Repository Pattern?

Where should the business logic go?

Explosion of methods on repositories and the Interface Segregation Principle

Testing repositories: integration vs. unit

Transactions: Are they a database or business concern?

Eager vs. lazy loading: The N+1 problem

Extension methods and query objects as an alternative

The misuse of reuse: "Hey, this looks like it does what I need it to do"

The Double Dispatch Pattern

Managing transactions and eventual consistency in distributed systems

Eventual inconsistency in the real world
