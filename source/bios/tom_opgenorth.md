I'm a software developer/programmer/contractor/consultant/nerd/geek who hails from Alberta, Canada. I've worked on a lot of different software projects in the past 20+ years in IT and have worn different hats - developer, QA, team lead, scapegoat, documentation, training and even a bit of project management thrown in.

My background is primarily .NET, C# in particular. I was even a Microsoft MVP in C# from 2008 – 2010. However, I've also worked in C/C++, Visual Basic, Java, Ruby, PHP, Perl, and a smattering of Python. It was in 2010 that I caught the mobile bug, Android in particular (although I do like iOS as well), and I've been trying to keep things focused on mobile in general.

Current I'm on contract to the great folks at Xamarin. If you're looking to make a **native** cross-platform mobile app, Xamarin is the only way to go IMHO.
