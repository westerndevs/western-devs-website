excerpt: "From our computers to yours, we wanted to take a moment to share with your part of our annual Western Devs Holiday Extranvaganza virtual celebration!"
---

Every year, the Western Devs try to put together a virtual holiday gathering across 7 timezones to catch-up, have fun, and celebrate the holiday season. To mark the occasion, we had AI generate a poem to help us enjoy the season along with an image for which will will not provide context for.

> 'Twas the night before Christmas, and all through the land
> The Western Devs group was busily at hand
> Working on projects, coding with care
> In hopes that the deadlines would soon be met, with flair
> 
> he computers were humming, the monitors aglow
> As the developers worked on code, to and fro
> Some were debugging, some were designing
> All with the goal of creating something exciting
> 
> But as the night wore on, and the work was almost through
> The developers stopped, and a cheer rose anew
> They had made it, they had finished the task
> Now it was time to put down the code and unwind at last
> 
> So they gathered around, for the holiday was here
> Raised a glass to a year of hard work and good cheer
> Here's to the Western Devs group, may your future be bright
> Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good night!

Have yourselves a great holiday season and new year!
