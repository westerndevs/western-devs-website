### Synopsis

* What happens under the covers in Visual Studio?
* Finding further use of compilers, debuggers, and source code analyzers
* TypeMock - Low level CLR to mock statics and sealed classes
* Reverse engineering without documentation
* OzCode - Tying into the debugger
* Developer tools vs. LOB apps
* How’d they do that?
* Going past F10 and F11
* Moving the debug point backward or forward
* Using Roslyn to hook into the build process
* Roslyn: opening the compiler black box. It’s not scary anymore
* Using Roslyn for domain-specific plugins
* ReSharper and DevExpress: Comparing a tool that isn’t switching to Roslyn to one that is
* Building tools that stay out of your way
