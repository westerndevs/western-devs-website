Until I walked through the doors of the Prairie Dev Con in 2022, I did not realize how much I missed it. The talented speakers that come together always bring fresh ideas to my mind and give me pause to think about my own efforts and how I can learn from their experience. Although not a complete list, these ideas the ones that stood out the most from Prairie Dev Con 2022.  

## API First Design ([Joël Hébert][5])  

Joel did a great session about API first design, which was a very dense session, but he delivered the content in a way that was very approachable and allowed me to think of the benefits of doing API first design with tools like [Swagger.io][1] and [OpenAPI][2].  

It was great seeing the value of these tools, and hearing about the patterns and practices experienced API developers like Joel use to implement consistent and secure APIs.  

## Developer Velocity Index ([AJ Enns][6]) 

I went into this session thinking I was going to be fascinated with the subject, but that the concept would apply only to development leads or possibly coders, rather than an architect like me.. 

I was wrong.  

The [Developer Velocity Index (DVI)][3], is a way for any team (even if it is a one-person team, like me on my side projects) can help frame up and scope the abstract problem of figuring out how do to deliver more value.  

I plan on applying the DVI to my side project adventures, self-development, and my enterprise day-job efforts as soon as possible.  

## End to End Testing ([Dave Paquette][7] and [Lavanya Mohan][8])  

Although Dave and Lavanya delivered two completely separate sessions related to testing, the content they delivered worked together in a very interesting way.   

Dave demonstrated and discussed [Playwright][4] and end-to-end testing framework that resolved or improved the problems we commonly see with end-to-end testing. Lavanya demonstrated how someone _should apply_ proper code management and development techniques when creating test code using a framework, like Playwright.  

For me, together they demonstrated why the test recorded features of end-to-end frameworks is not the "best approach" to creating tests, but rather it is only the first step.   

I feel that these ideas will be seeping into both my day-job and side projects in the very near future. 

## Cloud Security ([Adam Krieger][9]) 

Adam closed the Prairie Dev Con season with his session, and managed to leave me with a lot of ideas and helped me identify gaps that I have been living with as a developer and as a solution architect. 

Ensuring that developers are security-aware is something I didn't realize I have been missing in my own skills, but also should be looking for in the implementation of my solution designs. 

## A Deal is a Deal ([Rod Paddock][10]) 

Rod delivered a keynote in both Regina and Winnipeg, and each time I walked away with a positive outlook on my own professional and personal growth, but also with the reminder: A Deal Is A Deal.  

Sounds simple enough, but in the past I have frequently found myself regretting decisions or deals I had made with myself or others. But, a deal is a deal, and even if you don't like it or regret it, you need to take a moment to learn from it and ensure the next deal is one you won't regret. 

## TL;DR; / Conclusion 

In short, there were a lot of good ideas at Prairie Dev Con 2022. These are the ones that stood out to me the most: 

- Consider API First Design with tools like Swagger.io and OpenAPI (Joël Hébert)
- The Developer Velocity Index (DVI) is NOT just for developers, but for anyone looking to deliver value (AJ Enns) 
- End-to-End Testing is a thing that requires effort, but has major benefits with the right tools and patterns in practice (Dave Paquette and Lavanya Mohan) 
- Cloud Developers need not should be security-aware and not just depend others (Adam Krieger) 
- A deal is a deal, and if you don't like it, learn from it so the next one is better (Rod Paddock) 

Thanks for playing.
