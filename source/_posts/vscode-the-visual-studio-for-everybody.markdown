Last week I delivered three presentations: one at the [Winnipeg .NET User Group](http://winnipegdotnet.org/) and the other two at [Winnipeg Code Camp](http://winnipegcodecamp.com/). Being as awesome as we are, the user group presentation was recorded and has been published on the YouTube page.

<!--more-->

The presentation gives you an overview of the open source, cross-platform, code editor and covers:

+ The Editor Itself
+ Debugging Experience
+ Tasks, including integrating with Java-based task runner Gradle
+ Extensions, including writing your own
	
Feedback is always appreciated, and hopefully I'll get to see you at the next event in the new year.
