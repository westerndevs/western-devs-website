### Synopsis

- Getting Started: Launch your own or contribute
- It’s not as scary as you think
- Start with something you use
- Chime in on issues
- Taking over someone else’s project
- Managing a project doesn’t always involve a lot of time
- The maintainer may not have all the knowledge
- OSS already blog post
- Don’t wait for your project to be “ready"
- Helping new contributors
- The contributing.md file
- Communicate before submitting a PR
- Recognize that OSS is usually done on a “best effort” basis
- Find a balance between too much and not enough time on OSS
