### Synopsis

* Microsoft docs recommends using Razor pages by default for server-side rendering
* Razor pages != Razor views in MVC (though they're close)
* Making the case for ditching server-side rendering altogether
* Pre-rendering pages with a lot of data
* Targeting an appropriate level of interactivity
* If it's simple, there's often a SaaS for it
* Deciding between client-side and server-side
* Content management systems/Wordpress
* Internationalization
* Bootstrapping
