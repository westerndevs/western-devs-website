* Connecting devices together and the short-sightedness of proprietary access
* Off-the-shelf vs. build-your-own
* Encouraging good behaviour and learning through internet-enabled devices
* Advantages (and risks) in the health industry
* "See a need, fill a need": Sump pumps and coffeepots
* Does the light _really_ go out when you close the fridge?
* Accessibility of hardware to software people and vice versa
