						<div>
						
							I&#39;ve been noticing a bit of a trend lately around how some tools suggest you package your builds: they build differently for each environment. This is super-inconvenient if you&#39;re trying to progress a package through multiple environments. Just don&#39;t package configuration in with your build packages.

							Angular Testing Patterns - Leverage Observable
						</a><br/>
						
						<B>Simon Timms</B><BR>
						
						<div>
						
							One of the most challenging parts of testing is finding seams to reduce the scope of tests. Doing so is important because it make your tests smaller and cleaner which makes them more resilient to changes in the rest of your code base. Testing isn&#39;t helping you if every minor change breaks dozens of interconnected tests. Angular&#39;s heavy use of Observable provides us a great seam.

							If you happen to head over to https://www.nuget.org/packages and look at which package has been downloaded the most there is a clear winner: JSON.net. It is in everything, every where. JSON is so wildly ubiquitous that I play a little game with myself when I start a new project: how long can I go before I need to serialize or deserialize JSON and need to pull in JSON.net. I rarely last more than a couple of hours.
But it turns out that there is a lot more that JSON.net can do.

							Getting Started with RabbitMQ in ASP.NET

						<div>
						
							In the last post we looked at how to set up RabbitMQ in a Windows container. It was quite the adventure and I&#39;m sure it was woth the time I invested. Probably. Now we have it set up we can get to writing an application using it.
A pretty common use case when building a web application is that we want to do some background processing which takes longer than we&#39;d like to keep a request open for. Doing so would lock up an IIS thread too, which ins&#39;t optimal. In this example we&#39;d like to make our user creation a background process.

							Creating a Rabbit MQ Container
						</a><br/>

						<div>
						
							I bought a new laptop, a Dell XPS 15 and my oh my is it snazzy. The thing I was most excited about was that I&#39;d get to play with Windows containers again. I have 3 other machines in the house but they&#39;re either unsuitable for containers (OSX running Windows in parallels) or I&#39;ve so toally borked them playing with early betas of containers they need to be formatted and reinstalled - possibly also thrown into the sun.
So when I found myself presented with the question &amp;quot;how can we get into messaging in our apps for free?&amp;quot; I figured I&#39;d crack open the laptop and build something with MassTransit. I found that MassTransit supports running on RabbitMQ. Why that sounds like a perfect opportunity to deploy RabbitMQ to a container. Only problem was that I didn&#39;t really know how to do that.

At the same time I actually improved the performance of the application through more efficient socket usage.

							Copy Azure Blobs
						</a><br/>
						
						<B>Simon Timms</B><BR>
						
						<div>
						
							Ever wanted to copy blobs from one Azure blob container to another? Me neither, until now. I had a bunch of files I wanted to use as part of a demo in a storage container and they needed to be moved over to a new container in a new resource group. It was 10 at night and I just wanted it solved so I briefly looked for a tool to do the copying for me. I failed to find anything. Ugh, time to write some 10pm style code, that is to say terrible code. Now you too can benefit from this. I put in some comments for fun.

							Some time ago I lost a podcast recording because I stored it in /tmp. It is a bad habit but I tend to store things that I&#39;m not going to need in the long run in /tmp. It is a throw back to my real Linux days when storage was expensive and I might not be back on that machine for a while to figure out why all the space was used.

						<div>
						
							I&#39;ve been seeing a lot of this frustrating error when working with docker today. It turns out that pressing ^C when docker is downloading layers is not a good thing. In my case I changed hotspots which broke the download so I hit ^C. There are a couple of issues on github, here and here but basically nobody cares that the docker experience in this scenario is crummy. If you encounter this error it seems the only way to solve it is to restart the machine on which docker is running. If you&#39;re running docker against a VM then restarting the machine seems to fix it.

							I&#39;ve had this blog post percolating for a while. When I started it I was working for a large company that has some internal projects I was involved with deploying. I came to the project with a background in evolving projects rapidly. It has been my experience that people are not upset that software doesn&#39;t work so much as they are upset that when they discover a bug that it isn&#39;t fixed promptly.
